# 👀 About Me

I am a PhD student in the College of Computer Science and Technology of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

My research focuses on **Intelligent Software Engineering**, with a spotlight on the code generation.

My advisor is Professor [Yu Zhou](https://csyuzhou.github.io/) (周宇),  [Xiang Chen](https://smartse.github.io/) (陈翔), and [David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/).
I have published over 30 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JFoOXQwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the international conferences (e.g., ASE, ACL, EMNLP) and journals (e.g., TSE, TOSEM, EMSE).
